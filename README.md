### Bustle Implementation
- Implements two target languages: string manipulation and arithmetic language
- Use ```sbt "run arith"``` to run the synthesizer on the arithmetic tests
  - Arithmetic tests are max, min, square, sign, abs
- Use ```sbt "run string"``` to run the synthesizer on the string tests
  - String tests are taken from course site
- TODO: Add parsers to take in IO examples from files
- Possible extensions: Lists, functions, etc.
